In this tutorial we solve for laminar Poiseuille flow through a pipe.
We only mesh a small wedge-section of the pipe and utilize the wedge 
boundary condition to save computational time. 
Pay extra attention to the entrace length which is given as 
L_E = 0.05 * D * Re_D
And see if the solution satisfies this.
